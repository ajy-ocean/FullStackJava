Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in early 1990 by developers James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton. In 1991 James Gosling and his friends formed a team, called Green Team to further work on this project. The original idea was to develop this programming language for digital devices such as television, set-top box, remotes, etc. Later this idea was dropped and Java was designed for internet programming.

# _**`History of Java`**_
_**Original developer and programming name:**_
James Gosling is considered the original developer of Java language. He is also known as the _father of Java_. He started on this in the early 1990s. He originally named it Greentalk and the extension was .gt.

_**Programming language renamed from Greentalk to Oak:**_
When the Green team (James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton) started working on it, it was renamed to Oak.

_**Again renamed from Oak to Java in 1995:**_
The project is again renamed from Oak to Java in 1995 as Oak was a trademark for another organization.

_**The original and first version of Java:**_
JDK's first version alpha & beta was released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems.

**_Why Java was named as "Oak"?_**
Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc. In 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies. Since there was already an organization with the Oak name therefore Oak was renamed as Java.

_**Why had they chosen the name Java for Java language?**_
The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, easy to spell, and fun to say. According to James Gosling, "Java was one of the top choices along with Silk". Since Java was so unique, most of the team members preferred Java than other names.

1.  Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee).  It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having a cup of coffee nearby his office.
2.  Notice that Java is just a name, not an acronym.
3.  Initially developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.
4.  JDK 1.0 was released on January 23, 1996. Since the first release of Java, there have been many additional features added to the language. Now Java is being used in Windows applications, Web applications, enterprise applications, mobile applications, cards, etc. Each new version adds new features in Java.

# _**`What is Java`**_

1.  Java is described as being a multi-purpose, strongly typed, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language. By design, it has as few implementation dependencies as possible.
2.  With this programming language, we can create applications on multiple devices. Its scope is very wide, allowing us to create software for mobile devices, point-of-sale terminals, ATMs, IoT (Internet of Things), as well as web pages.
3.  Although Kotlin is the preferred language for Android development in 2021, Java is still the default language for developing apps for Android. The big reason for that is Android's tight integration with Java. In fact, parts of that OS, like the UI and specific core libraries, are written in Java.
4.  Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high-level, robust, object-oriented, and secure programming language.
5.  Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.**

### _**Why is Java a strongly typed language?**_
Java is considered strongly typed because it demands the declaration of every variable with a data type. Users cannot create a variable without the range of values it can hold. Once declared, the data type of the variable cannot be changed.

### _**What is a strongly typed programming language?**_
-  A strongly typed programming language is one in which each type of data, such as integers, characters, hexadecimal and packed decimals, is predefined as part of the programming language, and all constants or variables defined for a given program must be described with one of the data types. Certain operations might be allowable only with specific data types.
-  Strongly typed programming language refers to an idea that describes the enforcement of firm restrictions on mixing different data types and values. When there is a violation, errors, also known as exceptions, occur. Strongly typed programming languages use a language compiler to enforce data typing compliance.

### _**Strongly vs. loosely typed programming languages**_
-   In computer programming, a programming language is strongly typed if it demands the specification of data types. A programming language is loosely typed, or weakly typed, when it does not require the explicit specification of different types of objects and variables. The "looser" typing rules in weakly typed programming languages can produce erroneous or unpredictable results. It can execute implicit type conversions at runtime.
-   In programming languages, the concepts of strong and weak, or loose, typing are related to but different from static and dynamic typing. A programming language that is strongly typed can be either statically or dynamically typed.
-   In static typing, type checking takes place at compile time and catches such things as missing functions, invalid type arguments, or a mismatch between a data value and the type of variable to which it's assigned -- before the program has a chance to run the erroneous code and risk crashing. In dynamically typed languages, type checking occurs at runtime, so the compiler will ignore invalid type arguments or mismatched data. If the type checker detects an error, it will alert the developer to repair the code to avoid the program crashing.

### _**Why Java is a general-purpose programming language(multi-purpose)**_
In computer software, a general-purpose programming language (GPL) is a programming language designed to be used for building software in a wide variety of application domains, across a multitude of hardware configurations and operating systems. In theory, a GPL program can run equivalently on a single processor or on a network. The opposite of a general-purpose programming language is a domain-specific programming language, which is designed to be used within a specific area, for example, querying databases. For example, SQL was designed for querying databases.

# <u>Features Of Java Programming Language</u>

- Java is packed with full of features, yet it still maintains the simplicity and flexibility that allows a developer to quickly learn and start working on java projects with ease. 
- The flexibility of writing a java code on one machine and running it on several other machine makes it a popular choice in programming world.
- On top of that, the regular updates makes it safe and stable choice for the projects that intend to run for a longer period of time. The features of Java are also known as Java BuzzWords.

##### <u>A list of the most important features of the Java language is given below.</u>

1. Simple
2. Object-Oriented
3. Portable
4. Platform independent
5. Secured
6. Robust
7. Architecture neutral
8. Interpreted
9. High Performance
10. Multithreaded
11. Distributed
12. Dynamic


# 1. <u>Simple</u>
- Java is a very simple programming language, it is easy to learn, read and write in Java. The syntax of Java is clean and easy to understand.
- Here’s why java is simple programming language compared to other popular programming language:
- Java syntax is similar to C/C++ so it is easier to learn java if one is familiar with C or C++. However java doesn’t use the complex features of C and C++ such as Pointers, go to statements, preprocessors/ header files, multiple inheritance, operator overloading etc.

# 2. <u>Platform Independent</u>
- Java is platform-independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++, etc. which are compiled into platform-specific machines while Java is a write once, run-anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.
- There are two types of platforms software-based and hardware-based. Java provides a software-based platform.
- The Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it is a software-based platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms. 
- It has two components:
    1. Runtime Environment
    2. API(Application Programming Interface)
- Java code can be executed on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java code is compiled by the Compiler(javac). The java compiler converts source code (.java file) to the byte code(.class file). 
- JVM executes the bytecode produced by compiler. This byte code can run on any platform such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS etc. Which means a program that is compiled on windows can run on Linux and vice-versa.
- Each operating system has different JVM, however the output they produce after execution of bytecode is same across all operating systems. That is why we call java as platform independent language.
- This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA).

<u>IMP stuff</u>
* Java is platform-independent but JVM is not i.e JVM is platform-dependent which means for a given operating system you have to install compatible JVM.

# 3. <u>Secure</u>
* Security is one of the biggest concern in programming language as these programming langauges are used to develop some of the critical and sensitive applications that needs to be secured such as banking applications. 
* Java is more secure than C/C++ as it does not allow developers to create pointers, thus it becomes impossible to access a variable from outside if it’s not been initialized.
* Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox

# 4. <u>Object-oriented</u>
- Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.
- Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.

#### <u>Basic concepts of OOPs are:</u>
- Object
- Class
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

1.  **Abstraction**: Means hiding the implementation and showing the functionality to the user this we can achieve in java by using abstract keyword or else using concept of interface
2.  **Encapsulation**: It’s a process of binding data and code together into a single unit by making data private and accessing it through public environment
3.  **Polymorphism**: Poly means many and morph means form one object can perform multiple tasks as per argument we pass there are 2 type of polymorphism we have compile time and runtime.Method and Constructor Overloading is Compile time and Method Overriding is runtime
4.  **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism in which a one class acquired all the property and behavior of another class there are 5 type of inheritance we have a) **Single** b) **Multilevel** c) **Hierarchical** d) **Multiple** e) **Hybrid**.Multiple and Hybrid not supported due to diamond problems but this we can achieve in java by using Interface.

# 5. <u>Robust</u>
- Robust means reliable. Java programming language is developed in a way that puts a lot of emphasis on early checking for possible errors, that’s why java compiler is able to detect errors that are not easy to detect in other programming languages.
- The English mining of Robust is strong. Java is robust because:
	1. It uses strong Memory management as well as Memory allocation.
	2. There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.
	3. Java provides automatic garbage collection which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects which are not being used by a Java application anymore.
	4. There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in Java. All these points make Java robust.

# 6. <u>Distributed</u>
- In simple words: The java programs can be distributed on more than one systems that are connected to each other using internet connection. Objects on one JVM (java virtual machine) can execute procedures on a remote JVM.
- Using java programming language we can create distributed applications. RMI(Remote Method Invocation) and EJB(Enterprise Java Beans) are used for creating distributed applications in java.This feature of Java makes us able to access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.

# 7. <u> Multi-threaded</u>
- Java supports multithreading. Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilisation of CPU.
- A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.

# 8. <u>Dynamic</u>
- Java is a dynamic language. It supports the dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages, i.e., C and C++.
- Java also supports dynamic compilation and automatic memory management (garbage collection).
- Since its a dynamic programming language. OOPs allows developers to add new classes to the existing packages, add new methods to the existing classes as well as modifying the method without changing the original method code by using the concept of method overriding.
-  All these features make java dynamic. It also allows classes to be loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages such as C and C++.

# 9. <u>Performance</u>
- Java is significantly faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages. Compiled java code which is known as byte code is like a machine code, that allows a faster execution. Java uses Just in Time compiler which can execute the code on demand, this allows to execute only the method that is being called, which makes it faster and efficient.
- Also java uses the concept of multithreading, which allows concurrent execution of several parts of the code at the same time. This provides high performance.
- It is still a little bit slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++). Java is an interpreted language that is why it is slower than compiled languages, e.g., C, C++, etc.

# 10. <u>Portable</u>
- As discussed earlier, java code that is written on one machine can run on another machine. The platform-independent byte code can be carried to any platform for execution that makes java code portable.

# 11. <u>Architectural Neutral</u>
- As we know Java is a platform-independent language, which means programs written and compiled on one machine can run on any other machine having different operating systems. Java follows the principle of <b>“Write once run anywhere“.</b>
- Compiler converts the java file into byte code and this byte code is machine independent, java virtual machine can easily translate this byte code into machine-specific code. This makes java an architectural-neutral programming language.
- Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features, for example, the size of primitive types is fixed.
- In C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of memory for 64-bit architecture. However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 and 64-bit architectures in Java.

# 12. <u>Interpreted</u>
- In programming languages, you have learned that they use either the compiler or interpreter, but Java programming language uses both a compiler and interpreter. Java programs are compiled to generate bytecode files then JVM interprets the bytecode file during execution. Along with this JVM also uses a JIT compiler (it increases the speed of execution).
