Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in early 1990 by developers James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton. In 1991 James Gosling and his friends formed a team, called Green Team to further work on this project. The original idea was to develop this programming language for digital devices such as television, set-top box, remotes, etc. Later this idea was dropped and Java was designed for internet programming.


# _**`History of Java`**_
_**Original developer and programming name:**_
James Gosling is considered the original developer of Java language. He is also known as the _father of Java_. He started on this in the early 1990s. He originally named it Greentalk and the extension was .gt.

_**Programming language renamed from Greentalk to Oak:**_
When the Green team (James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton) started working on it, it was renamed to Oak.

_**Again renamed from Oak to Java in 1995:**_
The project is again renamed from Oak to Java in 1995 as Oak was a trademark for another organization.

_**The original and first version of Java:**_
JDK's first version alpha & beta was released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems.

**_Why Java was named as "Oak"?_**
Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc. In 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies. Since there was already an organization with the Oak name therefore Oak was renamed as Java.

_**Why had they chosen the name Java for Java language?**_
The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, easy to spell, and fun to say. According to James Gosling, "Java was one of the top choices along with Silk". Since Java was so unique, most of the team members preferred Java than other names.

1.  Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee).  It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having a cup of coffee nearby his office.
2.  Notice that Java is just a name, not an acronym.
3.  Initially developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.
4.  DK 1.0 was released on January 23, 1996. Since the first release of Java, there have been many additional features added to the language. Now Java is being used in Windows applications, Web applications, enterprise applications, mobile applications, cards, etc. Each new version adds new features in Java.

# _**`What is Java`**_

1.  Java is described as being a multi-purpose, strongly typed, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language. By design, it has as few implementation dependencies as possible.
2.  With this programming language, we can create applications on multiple devices. Its scope is very wide, allowing us to create software for mobile devices, point-of-sale terminals, ATMs, IoT (Internet of Things), as well as web pages.
3.  Although Kotlin is the preferred language for Android development in 2021, Java is still the default language for developing apps for Android. The big reason for that is Android's tight integration with Java. In fact, parts of that OS, like the UI and specific core libraries, are written in Java.
4.  Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high-level, robust, object-oriented, and secure programming language.
5.  Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.**

### _**Why is Java a strongly typed language?**_
**Java is considered strongly typed because it demands the declaration of every variable with a data type. Users cannot create a variable without the range of values it can hold. Once declared, the data type of the variable cannot be changed.**

### _**What is a strongly typed programming language?**_
-  A strongly typed programming language is one in which each type of data, such as integers, characters, hexadecimal and packed decimals, is predefined as part of the programming language, and all constants or variables defined for a given program must be described with one of the data types. Certain operations might be allowable only with specific data types.
-  Strongly typed programming language refers to an idea that describes the enforcement of firm restrictions on mixing different data types and values. When there is a violation, errors, also known as exceptions, occur. Strongly typed programming languages use a language compiler to enforce data typing compliance.

### _**Strongly vs. loosely typed programming languages**_
-   In computer programming, a programming language is strongly typed if it demands the specification of data types. A programming language is loosely typed, or weakly typed, when it does not require the explicit specification of different types of objects and variables. The "looser" typing rules in weakly typed programming languages can produce erroneous or unpredictable results. It can execute implicit type conversions at runtime.
-   In programming languages, the concepts of strong and weak, or loose, typing are related to but different from static and dynamic typing. A programming language that is strongly typed can be either statically or dynamically typed.
-   In static typing, type checking takes place at compile time and catches such things as missing functions, invalid type arguments, or a mismatch between a data value and the type of variable to which it's assigned -- before the program has a chance to run the erroneous code and risk crashing. In dynamically typed languages, type checking occurs at runtime, so the compiler will ignore invalid type arguments or mismatched data. If the type checker detects an error, it will alert the developer to repair the code to avoid the program crashing.

### _**Why Java is a general-purpose programming language(multi-purpose)**_
In computer software, a general-purpose programming language (GPL) is a programming language designed to be used for building software in a wide variety of application domains, across a multitude of hardware configurations and operating systems. In theory, a GPL program can run equivalently on a single processor or on a network. The opposite of a general-purpose programming language is a domain-specific programming language, which is designed to be used within a specific area, for example, querying databases. For example, SQL was designed for querying databases.
